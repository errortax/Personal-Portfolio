        <p> My journey as a participant in the Womentor 5 STEM women mentorship program has been a transformative experience, both professionally and personally. Under the guidance of my mentor Yameela Jahangir, who currently leads at Optimize and was formerly the Core Business Applications and Service Lead Engineer at Banglalink, I gained invaluable insights into the realms of telecom, 5G technology, cloud computing, and business applications.</p>

        <p>One of the most impactful moments during this mentorship was our visit to Prayash, a special educational institute dedicated to children with special needs in Bangladesh. Prayash operates under the patronage of the Bangladesh Army with a mission to nurture, educate, and empower children who face various neurodevelopmental challenges such as autism, cerebral palsy, and intellectual disabilities. Witnessing how the institute crafts individualized education programs and vocational training for these children opened my eyes to the importance of inclusivity and accessibility in building a better future for all members of society. </p>

        <p> This visit deepened my understanding of social responsibility and inspired me to think about how technology and business solutions can create meaningful impacts beyond just commercial success. Throughout the program, I learned not only about cutting-edge innovations in telecom and cloud technologies but also the value of leadership, mentorship, and community engagement.

My time with Womentor 5 and mentor Yameela has sharpened my professional skills and broadened my perspective, making me more committed to leveraging STEM expertise to solve real-world problems and contribute to societal advancement. I am grateful for the opportunity to be part of this empowering journey that fosters growth, learning, and positive change.</p>
