      <p> Being selected among the Top 60 participants of Huawei Seeds for the Future 2025 (Bangladesh) was one of the most transformative experiences of my academic and professional journey.

During the 3-day bootcamp, I served as the Deputy Team Leader of a 10-member group where we designed and presented a real-life innovative solution addressing one of Dhaka City‚Äôs most pressing urban challenges ‚Äî smart parking management. Our project integrated IoT and mobile-based technologies to create a seamless, efficient, and scalable parking solution aimed at reducing traffic congestion and improving city mobility.</p>

        <p>The intense, time-boxed format pushed us to prototype quickly, present clearly, and iterate under pressure. The bootcamp improved my rapid prototyping, pitching, and team coordination skills, and reinforced my interest in human-centered urban solutions.</p>

        <p>Overall, the experience was transformative ‚Äî it strengthened my problem-solving mindset and motivated me to keep building practical, tech-driven solutions for real-world challenges.</p>
