        <p>Battle of Minds 2023 was where I truly stepped out of my comfort zone. Coming from an engineering background, business competitions weren‚Äôt something I had ever imagined myself in. But I‚Äôve always been fascinated by how technology can be used to solve real problems ‚Äî that‚Äôs what pushed me to take part.</p>

        <p>For the initial round, our team proposed a tech-based medical insurance system ‚Äî an idea aimed at improving accessibility and efficiency in healthcare. To my surprise and excitement, that concept led our team to the bootcamp round, marking my first real experience in a business competition environment.</p>

        <p>The bootcamp was intense, exciting, and full of learning. I got to work with some amazing teammates, each bringing a different perspective. We spent hours brainstorming, did market safari, and prepared for FGD round. Every discussion taught me something new ‚Äî not just about business strategy, but also about teamwork, communication, and thinking beyond the technical aspects.</p>

        <p>When our team was announced as the champions in the quest, it felt surreal. But what stayed with me more than the victory was how much I had grown through the process. I learned how to express ideas more clearly, adapt quickly, and collaborate effectively with people from different backgrounds.</p>

        <p>Battle of Minds 2023 became one of the most memorable and enriching experiences of my journey so far ‚Äî one that gave me the confidence to explore, learn, and build beyond my own field.</p>
